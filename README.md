Some pointers 
1) I have used kotlin as the programming language.
2) I have developed it with MVVM design patterns using single activity architecture.
3) For Navigation I have used the navigation library along with safe args for type safety.
4) I have hosted the data on githubPage
5) I am using retrofit to get data from the mock API(githubPage)
6) Finally I have spent some time making the UI look good.
